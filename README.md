# Brain Tumor Detection — Bounding-Box Segmentation with YOLOv8  
**Author: Omar Madjitov**  
**Course: CSC 6850 — Machine Learning (Fall 2025)**  

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains my full pipeline for training, validating, and evaluating a **brain-tumor detection model** using **YOLOv8**.  

Originally, the project was defined as a **semantic segmentation** task. However, after inspecting the dataset, I discovered that **all COCO “segmentations” were rectangular polygons**, meaning the dataset **does not contain true pixel-accurate masks**. Every segmentation polygon is just a rectangle describing a tumor region.

Because of this, UNet (which requires organic, pixel-level masks) plateaued at **IoU ≈ 0.66**. I later confirmed that this was not an architecture failure—**the dataset’s mask geometry made true segmentation impossible**.

To correctly match the dataset’s nature, I redesigned the project as a **single-class bounding-box detection task** and implemented the complete pipeline with **YOLOv8-s**.

This repository includes:
- Full training pipeline  
- COCO → YOLO conversion  
- Raw IoU and pixel-accuracy evaluation  
- Test-set inference  
- COCO JSON reconstruction for grading  
- Visualizations  
- Fully reproducible Jupyter notebook

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer — Training Performed on a MacBook (MPS Backend)

All training and inference steps in this project were executed on:

- **MacBook Pro (M4 Max)**  
- **PyTorch MPS backend**

If you are running this on **Windows or Linux**, MPS will not be available.  

You must switch the device selection logic inside the notebook:

### On my machine:
```python
device = "mps"

On your machine (PC or Linux):

Use CUDA if you have an NVIDIA GPU:

device = "cuda"

Or CPU:

device = "cpu"

Recommended tools for PC users:
	•	NVIDIA GPU with CUDA 12.x
	•	PyTorch with CUDA support
	•	ultralytics==8.3.x
	•	Python 3.10 – 3.12

If you run into backend errors, this will be the reason.

🚀 How to Run the Notebook

Open Jupyter:

jupyter notebook

Run the notebook:

src/05_yolo_pipeline.ipynb

The notebook executes the entire pipeline in this order:
	1.	Dataset sanity checks
	2.	COCO → YOLO label conversion
	3.	Cache cleanup
	4.	YOLOv8 training
	5.	Prediction on validation set
	6.	Raw IoU computation
	7.	Pixel accuracy computation
	8.	Test-set prediction
	9.	Copy predictions into dataset/test/labels/
	10.	COCO JSON reconstruction for grading
	11.	Visualization samples

Everything is reproducible.

🧠 Model Training Summary

Final validation performance:

Metric	Score
Mean IoU	0.7299
Pixel Accuracy	0.9097
mAP@50	0.905

This exceeds the course’s required thresholds:

Requirement	Threshold	Achieved
IoU	≥ 0.70	0.7299
Pixel Accuracy	≥ 0.75	0.9097


⸻

📊 Visualizations

During validation and test evaluation, the notebook automatically generates:
	•	Predicted bounding boxes
	•	Overlay of predictions vs ground truth
	•	Random qualitative samples
	•	YOLO training curves (loss, precision, recall, F1, PR curve)

Examples are stored in:

experiments/yolo_run8/
experiments/yolo_run8_val_preds/
experiments/yolo_run8_test_preds/


⸻

🧪 Running Inference on the Test Set

YOLO predictions on test images:

!yolo predict \
    model=../experiments/yolo_run8/weights/best.pt \
    source=../dataset/test/images \
    save_txt=True \
    save_conf=True \
    conf=0.40 \
    project=../experiments \
    name=yolo_run8_test_preds

Copy YOLO outputs into the test labels folder:

import shutil, os

src = "../experiments/yolo_run8_test_preds/labels"
dst = "../dataset/test/labels"

for f in os.listdir(src):
    shutil.copy(os.path.join(src, f), os.path.join(dst, f))

print("Test labels copied.")


⸻

🧾 Generating COCO JSON for the Test Set

A full conversion script is included in the notebook.
It reconstructs a valid _annotations.coco.json with fields:
	•	info
	•	licenses
	•	categories
	•	images
	•	annotations

All bounding boxes are converted from YOLO normalized coordinates → COCO absolute coordinates.

Output saved to:

dataset/test/_annotations.coco.json

🏁 Final Notes

I wrote this repository so the grader — or any ML engineer evaluating my work — can run it end-to-end with zero ambiguity.
	•	The notebook is fully reproducible.
	•	Every step is explained and automated.
	•	The project uses bounding-box detection because the dataset does not contain real segmentation masks.
	•	All evaluation metrics match the project’s learning objectives.

If you have a CUDA GPU, training will run much faster than on MPS.
If you have questions, feel free to reach out through GitHub.

# 🔧 Troubleshooting & Common Issues

While preparing this project, I encountered several pitfalls related to:

- dataset formatting  
- COCO vs YOLO label inconsistencies  
- unsupported augmentations on MPS  
- cached label mismatches  
- YOLO predicting hundreds of bounding boxes when `conf=0.0`  
- proper filtering of predictions  

To help you avoid the same issues, I’ve included a troubleshooting guide below.

---

## ❗ Troubleshooting Guide

### 1. **YOLO Predicts Hundreds of Boxes Per Image**
If you see something like:

300 tumors detected

This simply means you are using:

conf=0.0

YOLO will output **every box before NMS filtering**.

**Fix:**
Use a realistic confidence threshold:
```bash
conf=0.40


⸻

2. MPS Not Supported / Crashing

If you are on Windows or Linux, remove:

device = "mps"

Use:

device = "cuda"    # if NVIDIA GPU exists

or:

device = "cpu"


⸻

3. YOLO Errors with .cache Files

If your dataset changes, you must clear YOLO’s cache:

import glob, os

for c in glob.glob("../dataset/**/*.cache", recursive=True):
    os.remove(c)


⸻

4. COCO → YOLO Conversion Produces Missing Labels

This occurs when images exist but labels do not.

The notebook automatically removes corrupted labels:

if not exists_image:
    os.remove(label_file)


⸻

5. Raw IoU Returns Zero

If IoU = 0 for all images:
	•	You may have used segmentation masks instead of bounding boxes.
	•	You may have compared normalized YOLO coordinates with absolute COCO coordinates.
	•	You may not have selected the highest-confidence predicted box.

The notebook fixes this by:
	•	taking the top-1 prediction
	•	converting YOLO → absolute box coords
	•	computing IoU safely

⸻

6. Pixel Accuracy > 0.90 Is Expected

Pixel accuracy is almost always high for tumor detection datasets because:
	•	~95% of pixels are background
	•	only a small region is tumor

This is normal.

⸻

📤 How to Reproduce Training from Scratch

If you want to fully retrain the model:

Step 1 — Convert COCO → YOLO

Run the first half of the notebook:
	•	sanity check images
	•	convert annotations
	•	clean corrupted labels
	•	delete .cache files

Step 2 — Train YOLOv8

model = YOLO("yolov8s.pt")

model.train(
    data="../dataset/dataset.yaml",
    epochs=30,
    imgsz=640,
    batch=8,
    device=device,
    task="detect",
    project="../experiments",
    name="yolo_run8",
    save=True,
    save_period=1,
    fliplr=0.5,
    flipud=0.0,
    augment=False
)

Step 3 — Save Predictions for Validation and Test

The notebook includes:

!yolo predict ...

📑 Academic Integrity & Project Notes

I include this section so the grader understands my research process.

✔ Why UNet Didn’t Work

UNet expects organic, pixel-accurate segmentation masks.
But this dataset contains only rectangular polygons.
UNet cannot infer tumor shape from rectangular masks; the model saturates early.

✔ Why YOLO Works Better

YOLO is designed for bounding box detection.
Bounding boxes are exactly what the dataset contains.
Therefore, YOLO matches the dataset’s geometry perfectly.

✔ Final Performance

YOLO produced:
	•	IoU: 0.7299
	•	Pixel Accuracy: 0.9097
	•	mAP@50: 0.905

These exceed the required thresholds for the course.
